##### Hey everyone, so I ordered the board and they arrived,
<br>
I all hear you ask when is the testing phase gonna start ?, response is I've manage to set up an appointement with a professor at my school that has both a BGA placing machine and a PCB oven **next Thursday**,<br>
however after some testing of the flex S-LCL interfaces, the soldering is quite hard, so I will have to check if soldering them is feasible. (One of my teacher agreed to try, and he's much better at soldering than me so I hope it's not a problem for him)<br>
P.S. This article is not only photos, there will be a bit more after them

<br><br>
Now before I yap more here some more photos of the boards,

<br>S-LCL FLex connectors:<br>

<br>JLCPCB accidentally sent me 4/6 copies instead of 5/5<br>

<br>Sorry for the kinda terrible picture quality

Now some photos of the mainboard:

#### What will happen after the test
So, If the test isn't successful I will have to return to the drawing board and you may not see a new protoype for a while
But if it's sucessfull, here the plan:
1.  review and clean up the design (someone is already helping me with that, thanks a lot to him (won't share his name since I only know his IRL name))
2.  Raise money for production
3.  Launch production and send every backer their board
4.  Sell the rest on the Tindie store (and other persons stores since I've heard a few were already interested)
5.  And in the future, if I decide I've gained engouth from this I will open source the design
<br><br>
And As for the future, I really hope this project can give me fund to develop more projects, <br>you might have seen that usually I don't post in depth tech explanation and schematics here, this is because after discussing my blog with someone, they advised me not to do that as to prevent a fake on my product even before I have the time to finish it, you see where I'm getting with this if I have fund then I can develop projects more for fun less for profit.

### Thanks to all article on the project
I want to thank all persons that wrote an article on this project, I will put here a small list of all articles I could find, weather in English, French, Portugese or even German
<br>I will be ordering them by order of me finding them more than by order of release
<br> Also most of them were posted on april fool's day, which is quite funny
