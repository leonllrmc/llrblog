######Hey everyone, so I ordered the board and they arrived,<br>
I all hear you ask when is the testing phase gonna start ?, response is I've manage to set up an appointement with a professor at my school that has both a BGA placing machine and a PCB oven next Thursday,<br>
 however after some testing of the flex LCL interface, the soldering is quite hard, so I will have to check if soldering them is feasable.
<br>
Now before I yap here some more photos of the boards
