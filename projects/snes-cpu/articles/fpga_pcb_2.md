Hey, the routing of the pcb has been done, it took me about 4 hours of hand-routing

Please note that the PCB is still slightly WIP, the mechanical form is unfinished

### Programmer
The custom programmer, who's pcb will be "printed" with the fpga mainboard (but will by default be left unmounted), is inspired from the upduino3.1 schematic
