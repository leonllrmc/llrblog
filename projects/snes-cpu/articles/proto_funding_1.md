##### Hey everyone,
After more test with the failed board, the error seams to be a dead FPGA, the problem is I don't have engouth components to rebuild a full board.<br>
Reflecting more about it, most of the delay in this project has been caused by me not being able to put a lot of money in this project.

Now if every people subscribed to the newsletter just gives me 5 CHF, I will have more than 500CHF, which would be probably engouth to buy a few prototypes iterations and I hope, complete a working production model.


<b>That isn't a production funding, if you give money in this fundraiser, even if it reaches the final goal, that doesn't guarantee that the project will ever reach the production stage</b>

Here is a link to the fundraiser: [Gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/f/developpement-costs-for-the-snes-fpga-cpu-replacement), Thanks who everyone who give even a little for helping me making this project a reality
