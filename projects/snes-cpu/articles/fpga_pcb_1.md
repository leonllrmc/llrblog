Hey, so now I will start talking about a part that recived virtually no attention on this blog yet: the FPGA mainboard
(There also some small updates)

# **This article is work in progress**

#### Photos of the PCB

Please note that the PCB is still WIP, the mechanical form is unfinished, stuff like the programming interface is missing, and the routing is still to do



### Commercialization
I decided that it will be sold on Tindie
