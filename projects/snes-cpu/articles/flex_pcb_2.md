Hey, so after some time, I've made great advancement in the project

First here some mechanical-prototypes for the flex PCBs, as I teased in the previous devlog

#### Photos of part1

Actually managed to do it 2 sided this time, but it didn't look good anyway

*Note: the weird artefacts are not the cause of AI as one may assume, but of my clumsy attemp to remove the flash glare for your viewing pleasure*

If you want an explanation for how I create these, don't hesistate to send me an email, and I will create a detailed guide =)


#### Adressing the new and future naming
the Flex PCB interface will now be named **S-LCL-CPU-P[1/2]**

For those who don't know, LCL is a reference to *Evangelion neon genesis*, in wich it's basically a liquid that allow neuronal connexion

#### Work on the mainboard
Schematic design and drawing of the mainboard has started, but routing will probably take quite a long time due to the sheer number of pins to wire

I will probably attemp to work with Fusion 360 router (Yes I know, half of the people I discussed that with told me it's pretty bad, but will try anyway)

The PCB is planned to be a 4 layer one, produced by JLCPCB, other details pending...
