#### Hey everyone

So this will be more of a quick update, as I allocate most of my time to the project and my studies.<br>
This test was not a success, but unlike last time the FPGA actually loaded it's programming and generates coherent signals<br><br>

Plans include debugging the firmware with logic analyzers and testing with custom cartridge code.<br><br>

Sorry for the shortness of this article but as stated it's just a quick update, <br>

I will write a more detailed article when there are more interesting update<br><br>
