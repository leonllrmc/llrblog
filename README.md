# llrblog
This is the code for my blog, hosted [here](https://llrblog.vercel.com)

it uses a mix of json files for metadata and Markdown for the actual content

Feel free to use it as the basis for your own blog

### NOTE: as of now the platform is terribly not responsive, viewing with PC (or tablet) is the preffered way to view it
